            Please note that we have observed various methods used to defraud the public, including Step Stop Solutions customers,
            through communication made with the unauthorized use of Library’s/Institution’s name and brand. The fraudsters are falsely
            presenting themselves as Step Stop Solutions’ employees, customer service representatives, or agents.

        <p class="text-justify mb-4">
            The purpose of such activities is to induce you to provide sensitive information or to pay a fee through a web-link or
            through other modes of communication. Please refrain from transferring any money or providing any details to such persons
            before verifying their authenticity. Step Stop Solutions or its representatives would never ask you to make additional
            payments for services of any kind.

            You are strongly advised to use only our official website to communicate with Step Stop Solutions. Many contact numbers
            or web-links provided over the internet, claiming to be Step Stop Solutions customer care, may be fraudulent.
