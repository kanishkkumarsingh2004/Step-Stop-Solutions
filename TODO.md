# Task: Add new column for total users with allocated cards in Library Card Allocation Counts page

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated `allocate_card_count` view in `my_library/library/views.py` to annotate libraries with `total_users_with_cards` count using `Count('card_allocation_logs__user', distinct=True)`
- [x] Added new column header "Total Users with Cards" in `my_library/library/templates/admin_page/allocate_card_count.html`
- [x] Added corresponding table cell to display `{{ library.total_users_with_cards }}` in the template

## Summary
The admin panel Library Card Allocation Counts page now displays an additional column showing the total number of users who have been allocated cards for each library. This is calculated by counting distinct users from the LibraryCardLog model for each library.
